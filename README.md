# üëã About 

I'm a programmer, [former academic](#-research--publications) and [music producer](https://linktr.ee/danielefilaretti).

Although lately my main focus have been on <em>music/audio technology</em>, 
I also have a keen interest in <em>functional programming</em> (with hands-on experience in languages such 
as Haskell and Clojure) and extensive research experience in the field of formal methods (static analysis, abstract interpretation, proof assistants etc.)

# üßë‚Äçüíª Stuff I'm working on

## Sweeper

<a href=""><img src="assets/img/sweeper-wip.png" align="right" width="500"/></a>

<em>Co-author & Lead developer<br>2024-Present</em>

An audio FX plugin designed in collaboration with acclaimed 
trance producer [Steve Allen](https://www.facebook.com/steveallenofficial/). It should be the first of a series of releases.

More info soon üî•

<a href="https://github.com/dfilaretti/img2ascii_rust"><img src="assets/img/img2ascii.png" align="right" width="400"/></a>

<em>Author<br>2025-Present</em>

As I've been [learning Rust](#-stuff-im-learning) during the last couple of months, I decided to get some practice by building this fun little project
that converts image files to ASCII art. 

One of the goals was also to familiarize with functional programming techniques in Rust 
(e.g. I didn't use any `for` loop to iterate through the image pixels, but relied on iterators facilities; also tried not to use `mut`able variables)

Check out the [README](https://github.com/dfilaretti/img2ascii_rust)!

# üå± Stuff I'm learning

## Rust

<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html"><img src="assets/img/rust-book.jpg" align="right" width="200"/></a>

As a C++ developer with some familiarity with functional programming languages such as Haskell, Rust definitely caught my attention. 

I love Rust's memory safety (coming from C++, it's a big thing!), modern and smooth tooling experience and those language features (expression-oriented, algebraic data types, iterators, immutability by default etc.) that makes it feel a bit more like a functional language while still giving you all the power and performance of C++ (and the ability to work on audio plugins, which is pretty much exclusive domain of C++!)

To get started with the language I am...

- reading the official [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
- completing the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises
- as a little, fun project, developing a small CLI app to convert images to ASCII art ([repo](https://github.com/dfilaretti/img2ascii_rust))

# üéß Past projects (audio / music technology)

## Loopcloud

<em>Developer<br>2020-2024</em>

Since 2020, I contributed to the development of the Loopcloud desktop app and its companion audio plugin 
(which syncs the app to the user's DAW for a more integrated experience).

I delivered several new major features (such as <em>collections</em>, MIDI support and an onboarding interactive tutorial), 
and an extensive UI rework, in addition to countless bug fixes and workflow improvements.

<br><br><br><br>

<a href="https://k-devices.com/products/tatat/"><img src="assets/img/tatat-dark.png" align="right" width="500"/></a>

<em>Lead developer<br>2021-2022</em>

[TATAT](https://k-devices.com/products/tatat/) is a MIDI plugin designed for 3 main purposes: to 
create always-changing sequences, to quickly sketch and store music ideas, to add unexpected 
events to fixed patterns.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Solid State Logic (SSL) 

<a href=""><img src="assets/img/ssl-1.png" align="right" width="300"/></a>

<em>Developer<br>2016-2017</em>

I had the privilege of working at legendary SSL headquarters in Oxford. 

During my tenure there I helped develop and maintain the software powering Solid State Logic‚Äôs high-end digital consoles in both the Broadcast (System T) and Live (L200, L350 etc.) product families (C#).

## Uplift Arpeggio

<a href="https://github.com/dfilaretti/uplift-arpeggio"><img src="assets/img/uplift-arpeggio.png" align="right" width="500"/></a>

<em>Author<br>2020-Present</em>

A Max4Live device I built for helping me quickly come up with lead 
patterns when writing trance. It started as a 2020 lockdown project 
but it's still receiving updates!

<em>Author<br>2018</em>

A bunch of free audio plugins I wrote while learning JUCE.

 - a nice [drum synth](https://github.com/dfilaretti/WeirdDrums)
 - a simple [waveshaper](https://github.com/dfilaretti/waveshaper-demo)
 - [stereo width](https://github.com/dfilaretti/stereowidth-demo) utility

# üë®‚Äçüíª Past projects (misc)

## Yapster

<a href=""><img src="assets/img/yapster.png" align="right" width="175"/></a>
<em>Clojure Developer (full-stack)<br>2019 - 2020</em>

Helped developing [Yapster](https://www.yapster.info/) - a messaging app for the workplace; contributing new features across both frontend and backend as well as bug-fixes (Clojure/ClojureScript).

I <em> really </em> enjoyed learning and working with the [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) 
programming language! 

<br><br><br>

## K-Framework (Haskell backend)

<a href="https://github.com/runtimeverification/haskell-backend"><img src="assets/img/k-logo-dark.png" align="right" width="200"/></a>

<em>Developer<br>2018</em>

According to its [official docs](https://kframework.org/index.html), 

<em>"K is a rewrite-based executable semantic framework in which programming languages, 
type systems and formal analysis tools can be defined using configurations and rules"</em>

I loved using K as the foundational framework for my [research work](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~maffeis/phpsemantics/) as a PhD student,  
and I was privileged, a couple of years later, to be able to contribute 
back to its community (as well as practicing some [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)!)

<br><br>

## Solidity to IELE compiler

<a href="https://github.com/runtimeverification/haskell-backend"><img src="assets/img/iele-2.png" align="right" width="200"/></a>

<p><em>Developer<br>2018</em></p>

[IELE](https://runtimeverification.com/the-iele-virtual-machine) is an improvement on the [Ethereum blockchain virtual machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).
 It was created after the [KEVM](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics) project demonstrated that a K formal specification of EVM could automatically generate a VM comparable in performance to hand-crafted implementations.

I helped developing the Solidity to IELE compiler.

<br><br><br>

## DIMMAND

<a href="https://www.festoon.studio/dimmand"><img src="assets/img/dimmand.png" align="right" width="200"/></a>

digital solution for detecting literacy difficulties 
& strengths in children.

# üß™ Research & publications

I hold a PhD in <em>Computing</em> from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked in the field
of <em>programming language</em> theory and <em>formal methods</em>. 

My thesis was about the formalisation of the PHP programming language 
and the development of a static analysis tool derived from the formal semamtics (see below).

Here are the main research projects and publications I worked on during the years. 

## Projects

### K-PHP (Executable formal semantics of PHP)

<em>Lead Developer / PhD Student<br>2018</em>

[KPHP](https://github.com/dfilaretti/KPHP) is a <em>formal specification</em> of the PHP 
programming language written in the [K-Framework](https://kframework.org/index.html), 
together with a prototype bug finding tool based on the theory 
of [abstract interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation) 
and derived directly from the formal semantics.
